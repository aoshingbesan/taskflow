## üéØ **Stage 2: Code Modification (2 minutes)**

### **Required Demonstrations:**
1. **Make Visible Code Change**
   - Modify UI text in templates
   - Change welcome message or page title
   - Update CSS styling for visual impact

2. **Commit Using Conventional Commits**
   - Use format: `feat: update welcome message for demonstration`
   - Show commit in terminal/IDE

3. **Push to Feature Branch**
   - Create new feature branch: `git checkout -b demo/update-welcome-message`
   - Push changes: `git push origin demo/update-welcome-message`

### **Suggested Changes:**
```html
<!-- In app/templates/main/index.html -->
<h1>Welcome to TaskFlow - Your Personal Task Manager</h1>
<!-- Change to: -->
<h1>Welcome to TaskFlow - Professional Task Management System</h1>
```

### **Script:**
```
"Now I'll demonstrate the development workflow by making a small, visible change to the application. I'm updating the welcome message to reflect the professional nature of our system.

I'll commit this change using the Conventional Commits standard, which ensures proper version tracking and automated changelog generation. Notice the 'feat:' prefix indicating this is a new feature.

I'm pushing this to a feature branch, which follows our branching strategy and ensures changes are properly reviewed before deployment..."

## üéØ **Stage 3: Staging Deployment (3 minutes)**

### **Required Demonstrations:**
1. **Create Pull Request**
   - PR from feature branch to `develop`
   - Show GitHub interface

2. **Explain Pipeline Execution**
   - **Build Process**: Docker image building
   - **Testing Procedures**: pytest, linting, formatting
   - **Security Scanning**: Safety, Bandit results

3. **Demonstrate Staging Deployment**
   - Show staging URL: https://taskflow-staging.azurewebsites.net
   - Confirm changes are deployed

### **Pipeline Explanation Points:**
```
"Let me create a pull request to merge our changes into the develop branch. This triggers our automated CI/CD pipeline.

The pipeline follows a comprehensive sequence:
1. **Security Scanning**: Safety checks for dependency vulnerabilities and Bandit for code security
2. **Code Quality**: Black formatting and Flake8 linting ensure consistent code style
3. **Testing**: pytest runs our test suite with coverage reporting
4. **Build**: Docker image is built and pushed to GitHub Container Registry
5. **Deployment**: Application is deployed to staging environment
6. **Health Checks**: Automated verification ensures deployment success

The pipeline takes approximately 3-5 minutes to complete. Once finished, our changes will be live on the staging environment..."
```

## üéØ **Stage 4: Production Release (2 minutes)**

### **Required Demonstrations:**
1. **Merge to Main Branch**
   - Show merge process
   - Explain production deployment trigger

2. **Manual Approval Step**
   - Show GitHub Actions workflow
   - Explain production deployment safeguards

3. **Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Azure Application Insights dashboard
   - Alarm configuration and alerting

### **Script:**
```
"Now I'll merge our changes into the main branch, which triggers the production deployment pipeline. Notice that production deployments require additional safeguards and monitoring.

The production pipeline includes:
- Manual approval steps for critical deployments
- Enhanced security scanning
- Comprehensive health checks
- Monitoring dashboard integration

Let me show you our Azure Application Insights monitoring dashboard, which provides real-time visibility into application performance, error rates, and user experience. We have configured alarms for high response times and error rates to ensure proactive issue detection..."
```
