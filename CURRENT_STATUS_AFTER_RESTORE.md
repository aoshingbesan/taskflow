   - ✅ **Security scanning** - Safety and Bandit active

## ⚠️ **ENVIRONMENTS NEED DEPLOYMENT**

### **Current Environment Status:**

**Production Environment**:
- **URL**: https://taskflow-app.azurewebsites.net
- **Status**: ❌ **UNHEALTHY** (HTTP 503)
- **Issue**: Needs fresh deployment after git reset
- **Action**: Force push triggered, waiting for deployment

**Staging Environment**:
- **URL**: https://taskflow-staging.azurewebsites.net
- **Status**: ❌ **UNHEALTHY** (HTTP 000 - Connection error)
- **Issue**: Needs fresh deployment after git reset
- **Action**: Force push triggered, waiting for deployment

## 🎯 **EXPECTED OUTCOME**

### **After Deployments Complete:**
- ✅ **Production**: Should return to HTTP 200 (working state)
- ✅ **Staging**: Should return to HTTP 200 (working state)
- ✅ **All Features**: Authentication, tasks, API should work
- ✅ **CI/CD**: Automated deployments should function

## 📋 **NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Wait for Deployments** - GitHub Actions should be running
2. **Test Environments** - Check both URLs after deployment
3. **Verify Features** - Test authentication, tasks, API
4. **Confirm CI/CD** - Ensure automated pipeline works

### **If Environments Still Down:**
1. **Check GitHub Actions** - Verify deployment logs
2. **Manual Restart** - Restart App Services if needed
3. **Environment Variables** - Verify settings are correct
4. **Startup Commands** - Confirm gunicorn configuration

## 🎉 **RESTORE SUCCESS**

**The application has been successfully restored to a clean checkpoint with:**
- ✅ Clean git history
- ✅ FlaskMiddleware fix applied
- ✅ Force pushed to trigger deployments
- ✅ Ready for fresh deployments

**The environments should come back online once the deployments complete!**
