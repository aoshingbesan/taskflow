# Production Deployment Issue Analysis

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Components
- **Staging Environment**: Fully functional at https://taskflow-staging.azurewebsites.net
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Successfully configured and connected
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline working for staging
- **Azure Infrastructure**: All resources properly provisioned
- **Local Development**: Application runs correctly locally

### ❌ Production Environment Issue
- **Production URL**: https://taskflow-app.azurewebsites.net
- **Status**: Application Error (:( Application Error)
- **Last Deployment**: Failed during pip install step

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Deployment Pipeline Differences
- **Staging**: Deploys from `develop` branch via GitHub Actions
- **Production**: Deploys from `main` branch via GitHub Actions
- **Issue**: Production deployment fails during package installation

### 2. Configuration Comparison
Both environments have identical settings:
- Python 3.11 runtime
- Same MongoDB URI
- Same environment variables
- Same port configuration (8000)

### 3. Possible Causes
1. **GitHub Actions Pipeline**: Production workflow may have different triggers or conditions
2. **Azure App Service**: Production instance may have different build context
3. **Dependencies**: Some packages may fail to install in production environment
4. **Code Differences**: Main branch may have different code than develop branch

## Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Verify GitHub Actions
```bash
# Check if production deployment is triggered
# Look for any failed jobs in the Actions tab
```

### Step 2: Manual Deployment Test
```bash
# Try manual deployment to production
az webapp deployment source config --name taskflow-app --resource-group taskflow-rg --repo-url https://github.com/aoshingbesan/taskflow.git --branch main --manual-integration
```

### Step 3: Check Build Logs
```bash
# Enable detailed logging
az webapp log config --name taskflow-app --resource-group taskflow-rg --web-server-logging filesystem --detailed-error-messages true --failed-request-tracing true
```

### Step 4: Compare Branch Differences
```bash
# Check if main and develop branches have differences
git diff main develop
```

## Immediate Actions

1. **Create Pull Request**: Merge develop to main to ensure code consistency
2. **Manual Deployment**: Try deploying directly from develop branch to production
3. **Log Analysis**: Enable comprehensive logging and analyze deployment logs
4. **Environment Sync**: Ensure production has same configuration as staging

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Production environment responds to health checks
- [ ] User registration and login work
- [ ] Task management functionality works
- [ ] API endpoints are accessible
- [ ] MongoDB connection is established

## Next Steps

1. Investigate GitHub Actions production workflow
2. Compare main vs develop branch code
3. Try manual deployment approach
4. Enable detailed logging for debugging
5. Consider redeploying staging configuration to production
