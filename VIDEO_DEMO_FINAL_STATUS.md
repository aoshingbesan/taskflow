## 🎬 **Video Demonstration Strategy**

### **Primary Approach: Staging-Focused Demonstration**
Since staging environment is fully functional and demonstrates all required capabilities:

1. **Stage 1**: Show staging as production-like environment
2. **Stage 2**: Make code changes and demonstrate CI/CD
3. **Stage 3**: Show staging deployment (working perfectly)
4. **Stage 4**: Explain production deployment process
5. **Stage 5**: Verify changes in staging environment

### **Key URLs for Demonstration:**
- **Main Application**: https://taskflow-staging.azurewebsites.net
- **Health Check**: https://taskflow-staging.azurewebsites.net/health
- **API Health**: https://taskflow-staging.azurewebsites.net/api/v1/health
- **API Documentation**: https://taskflow-staging.azurewebsites.net/docs
- **GitHub Repository**: Your repo URL
- **Azure Application Insights**: Dashboard URL
